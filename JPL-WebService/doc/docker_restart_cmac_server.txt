== a few directories:

The html/js files:
/home/svc/JPL-WebService/ApacheCMDA-Frontend/public/html/

the service code files:
/home/svc/JPL-WebService/services/svc/svc/src/

run.py, start.sh:
/home/svc/JPL-WebService/services/svc/

entry.py:
 /home/svc/JPL-WebService/services/svc/svc/services/

== commands

Do the following as the user "svc".

# to kill all python processes (including the gunicorn)
/home/bytang/bin/mine/killps -p python -e

# to list all python processes but not to kill:
/home/bytang/bin/mine/killps -p python

# to start the server in the background:
cd /home/svc/JPL-WebService/services/svc
./start.sh

# to start the server in the foreground (for debugging)
python run.py
